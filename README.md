E-commerce Web Application Documentation
Overview
This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the development process and components of the e-commerce web application created for the SCALEUP case study.

Project Structure
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Local data (VS Code)
Database: Local data (VS Code)

Frontend Development

Homepage

Developed a homepage with a dynamic product grid layout, optimized for responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes. The layout adjusts seamlessly to ensure an optimal user experience under different viewing conditions.
Applied custom CSS for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Product Category Filters
Implemented product category filters to allow users to filter products based on different categories.
React.js was used to handle dynamic rendering based on selected filters.

Shopping Cart Page

Designed a shopping cart page where users can add or remove products.
Integrated state management to store and manage the shopping cart state efficiently.
Backend Development

Data Handling

In the process, I encountered the need to work with SQL for the first time, and although I had to learn it from scratch, I managed to create tables for storing product information. However, due to the limited timeframe and the challenge of importing images from the SQL data, I opted to leverage local data in VS Code for faster and more efficient development.

Shopping Cart State Management
Implemented server-side logic to manage the shopping cart state.

Version Control and Deployment

Version Control

Created pull request to simulate collaboration.
Deployment

In conclusion, due to the limited time frame, I faced challenges in fully implementing all aspects of the e-commerce web application. While I successfully developed a responsive homepage with a dynamic product grid layout, challenges arose in utilizing local data tables for storing product information. Despite efforts to create tables, time constraints prompted the decision to rely on local data within the VS Code environment.

Regrettably, due to time constraints, certain elements such as backend development using Node.js, deployment on cloud platforms like Vercel, optional AI integration, and full documentation adherence were not accomplished within the stipulated timeframe.

Given more time, I would prioritize resolving the integration issues with local data tables, complete backend development, and enhance the application's features. Additionally, I would aim to deploy the application on a cloud platform and explore opportunities for optional AI integration.

As part of this project, I am also providing SQL scripts that were initially intended for storing and retrieving product information.

This case study has provided valuable insights into the complexities of building a web application within a short timeframe, and I look forward to further refining and expanding the project given additional resources and time.
